# The Proposal Engine
## One-Page Collaborative Investment Brief

### The Ask
We are inviting a financially capable partner to do more than invest: co-lead application discovery to identify where asynchronous computing creates the strongest operational and economic outcomes.

### The Opportunity
Most compute stacks still depend on clock-driven architectures that struggle with:
- power and thermal constraints
- timing uncertainty in control-heavy systems
- escalating software validation complexity

Asynchronous multi-core fabric offers a structural alternative with deterministic behavior, explicit partitioning, and activity-based efficiency.

### Why Our Model Wins
We do not push a top-down platform replacement.  
We run a discovery-first commercialization model:
1. Map high-cost bottlenecks in real workloads.
2. Select narrow, high-impact insertion points.
3. Co-build production-relevant prototypes.
4. Measure KPI outcomes.
5. Scale only proven wins.

### Where We Start
Typical early targets:
- fast control loops
- waveform/pulse generation
- safety interlocks
- low-latency edge preprocessing

HVDC controller work demonstrates feasibility in demanding conditions, but the strategy is intentionally cross-domain.

### Partner Value
- early position in a differentiated compute category
- direct influence over roadmap and domain focus
- measurable pilots before large capital commitment
- first rights on validated deployment pathways

### What We Need
- pilot and scaling capital
- access to real workloads and technical teams
- active participation in application prioritization
- commitment to evidence-based expansion

### Decision Lens
If your objective is long-term strategic upside through guided market fit, not passive exposure, this partnership model is built for that mandate.
