# The Proposal Engine
## A Collaborative Venture in Asynchronous Computing Discovery

### Core Invitation
We are not seeking a passive investor.  
We are seeking a financially enabled collaborator to co-discover where asynchronous compute delivers the highest practical and economic return inside real workloads.

This is a partnership model: capital plus active problem selection, validation, and deployment strategy.

### Why This Matters Now
Modern systems are increasingly constrained by power, thermal density, timing uncertainty, and software validation burden. Conventional clock-driven architectures often address these pressures with added complexity rather than structural change.

Asynchronous multi-core fabric offers a different path:
- deterministic timing without global clock dependency
- physically partitioned compute for fault containment
- energy use tied more closely to useful activity
- reduced coupling between critical control and noncritical functions

The opportunity is to identify exactly where these properties create outsized advantage in production systems.

### Discovery-First Commercial Model
Our commercialization approach is application discovery before scale.

We run a structured engagement process with a partner organization:
1. Identify system pain points with direct business impact.
2. Select narrow, high-leverage subsystems for rapid validation.
3. Co-build production-relevant prototypes with partner engineers.
4. Quantify outcomes against agreed KPIs.
5. Expand only where value is demonstrated.

This de-risks adoption, shortens time to credible evidence, and creates internal champions who can drive integration.

### What We Explore Together
We target domains where determinism, reliability, and energy efficiency are strategic:
- infrastructure control systems
- industrial automation and robotics
- edge AI preprocessing and signal pipelines
- aerospace and defense computing envelopes
- high-reliability sensing and safety-critical control paths

Initial insertion points are intentionally focused, such as:
- fast control loops
- pulse generation and waveform shaping
- safety interlocks and protection logic
- telemetry preprocessing under tight latency constraints

### HVDC Is a Demonstration, Not a Limitation
The HVDC controller use case demonstrates concrete feasibility in a demanding control environment: high-speed loop behavior, precision switching control, and partitioned execution under noisy electrical conditions.

It is an example of method, not the boundary of opportunity.

### Partnership Thesis
This venture is built on a clear premise:
- asynchronous architecture is a structural alternative, not an incremental optimization
- broad market adoption requires proof in context, not abstract claims
- the best opportunities emerge through joint technical and commercial discovery

The right partner helps choose where to prove value first, then helps scale what works.

### Engagement Structure (Draft)
- Phase 1: Joint Discovery (workload mapping, KPI definition, insertion-point selection)
- Phase 2: Pilot Builds (co-developed prototypes in one to three target subsystems)
- Phase 3: Measured Validation (performance, reliability, and economic metrics)
- Phase 4: Expansion Decision (portfolio roadmap, deployment model, go-to-market alignment)

### What We Need From a Partner
- financial capacity to fund disciplined pilots and follow-on scaling
- willingness to engage in technical selection and workload prioritization
- access to real operational contexts where value can be measured
- commitment to evidence-based expansion

### What the Partner Gets
- early position in a differentiated compute paradigm
- direct influence over application roadmap and vertical focus
- first-mover advantage in validated, high-leverage deployments
- ownership in a commercialization path grounded in measurable outcomes

### Closing
The Proposal Engine is a vehicle for finding the highest-value fit between asynchronous architecture and real-world demand.

If your objective is not just to place capital, but to shape where this technology creates durable advantage, this is the collaboration model.
