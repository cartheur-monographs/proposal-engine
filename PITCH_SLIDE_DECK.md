# The Proposal Engine
## 10-Slide Partner Deck Outline

### Slide 1: Title
**The Proposal Engine**  
Collaborative Application Discovery for Asynchronous Compute  
Subtitle: Capital + Co-Discovery + Measurable Deployment Value

### Slide 2: The Core Problem
- Critical systems face power, thermal, and timing constraints.
- Clock-driven architectures add complexity to compensate.
- Organizations need deterministic, efficient, field-reliable compute.

### Slide 3: The Strategic Opportunity
- Asynchronous multi-core fabric is a structural alternative.
- Potential advantages:
- deterministic local execution
- partitioned fault containment
- activity-based efficiency
- lower validation and integration friction in targeted subsystems

### Slide 4: Why This Is a Partnership, Not Passive Investment
- We are not selling a blind platform bet.
- We are proposing joint application discovery:
- identify high-value insertion points
- co-build prototypes in real workloads
- scale only where KPI evidence is strong

### Slide 5: Discovery-to-Scale Model
1. Joint workload mapping  
2. Insertion-point selection  
3. Pilot prototype builds  
4. KPI measurement and business case  
5. Expansion roadmap

### Slide 6: Proof Point and Generalization
- HVDC controller case demonstrates feasibility in demanding control conditions.
- The strategy is broader than HVDC:
- infrastructure
- industrial automation
- edge sensing and control
- reliability-critical domains

### Slide 7: Partner-Specific Wedge (Forest + Sustainable Ag)
- Remote operations with tight power and connectivity limits.
- Need for edge autonomy, reliability, and long-lifecycle systems.
- Strong sustainability and productivity pressure.

### Slide 8: Forest and Agriculture Pilot Use Cases
- wildfire/forest anomaly preprocessing at the edge
- precision irrigation control timing
- environmental sensor data filtering and prioritization
- predictive maintenance preprocessing for equipment fleets
- controlled-environment microclimate loop control

### Slide 9: KPI and Value Framework
- energy consumed per site or per decision event
- time-to-detection and response for anomalies
- water-use efficiency improvement
- reduced downtime and maintenance costs
- false-alert reduction and operator workload impact

### Slide 10: The Ask and Next 90 Days
- Ask:
- partner capital for pilots and scale-stage execution
- direct participation in workload prioritization
- access to operating environments and team collaboration

- Next 90 days:
1. discovery workshops
2. select 1-3 pilot subsystems
3. deploy prototype builds
4. report KPI-based go/no-go scale decision
