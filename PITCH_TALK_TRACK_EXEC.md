# The Proposal Engine
## Executive Talk Track (10 Slides, ~20s Each)

### Slide 1: Title
“The Proposal Engine is a co-discovery partnership for asynchronous computing. We combine capital and targeted pilots to find where this architecture delivers measurable real-world advantage.”

### Slide 2: Problem
“Critical systems are constrained by power, thermal load, and timing uncertainty. Conventional clocked stacks often respond with complexity, which increases integration and validation cost.”

### Slide 3: Opportunity
“Asynchronous multi-core fabric offers deterministic local execution, explicit partitioning, and activity-based efficiency. That creates a credible path to better reliability and lower operational overhead in the right workloads.”

### Slide 4: Partnership Model
“This is not a passive investment ask. We jointly choose use cases, run focused pilots, and scale only where KPI evidence is strong.”

### Slide 5: Method
“Our sequence is disciplined: map bottlenecks, select insertion points, co-build pilots, measure outcomes, then decide expansion. That structure controls risk while accelerating learning.”

### Slide 6: Proof Point
“HVDC control demonstrates feasibility in a demanding environment. It validates the method, while the commercial strategy remains intentionally cross-domain.”

### Slide 7: Forest + Ag Fit
“Forest management and sustainable agriculture are ideal early domains: remote operations, power limits, intermittent connectivity, and strong need for resilient edge intelligence.”

### Slide 8: Pilot Candidates
“First pilots can include wildfire signal preprocessing, precision irrigation timing, environmental sensor filtering, and predictive maintenance preprocessing.”

### Slide 9: KPI Framework
“Success is measured with hard metrics: energy per site, detection latency, water-use efficiency, downtime reduction, false-alert rates, and maintenance burden.”

### Slide 10: Ask + 90 Days
“We ask for pilot capital, operational access, and active prioritization. In 90 days: discovery workshops, 1-3 pilots, prototype deployment, and KPI-based scale recommendations.”

## Delivery Guidance
- Target total runtime: 3:30-4:00.
- Keep transitions crisp and data-oriented.
- Reserve detail for Q&A; lead with outcomes and decision gates.
