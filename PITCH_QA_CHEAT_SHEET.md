# The Proposal Engine
## Investor Q&A Cheat Sheet

### 1) What is the core business, in one sentence?
We run a discovery-first commercialization model that identifies where asynchronous compute delivers measurable operational and economic gains, then scales only validated use cases.

### 2) Why now?
Clock-driven architecture gains are increasingly constrained by power, thermal, and complexity limits, while real-world workloads are becoming more distributed, real-time, and energy-sensitive.

### 3) Why is this not just another chip story?
The value proposition is not “faster chip claims.” It is a repeatable process that maps architectural properties to concrete customer pain points and KPI outcomes.

### 4) What is technically differentiated?
- deterministic local execution without global clock dependency
- explicit partitioning for fault containment
- activity-driven efficiency for constrained edge/control contexts
- reduced cross-coupling between critical and noncritical functions

### 5) What is the moat?
- application-fit know-how built through pilots in live environments
- deployment playbooks and integration patterns by vertical
- early partner relationships and data from measured outcomes
- domain-specific credibility in reliability-critical use cases

### 6) Why is HVDC mentioned if the scope is broader?
HVDC is a demanding proof point that validates method and feasibility. It is intentionally treated as one example, not the market boundary.

### 7) How do you handle adoption friction?
We avoid “replace everything” pitches. We start with narrow insertion points, co-develop pilots with customer engineers, and expand only after KPI proof.

### 8) What are the first commercial targets?
Reliability- and determinism-sensitive subsystems in infrastructure, industrial control, and edge operations, including forest management and sustainable agriculture workloads.

### 9) Why forest management and sustainable agriculture?
These sectors combine remote deployment, power constraints, intermittent connectivity, and clear sustainability KPIs, making value demonstration both practical and measurable.

### 10) What KPIs define success?
- energy consumption per site/process
- detection and response latency
- false-alert reduction
- downtime and maintenance cost reduction
- resource-use efficiency (for example, water-use efficiency)

### 11) What are the top technical risks?
- integration complexity with incumbent stacks
- tooling maturity and developer onboarding
- proving repeatability across heterogeneous environments

### 12) How are those risks mitigated?
- phased pilots with strict scope
- paired engineering with customer teams
- explicit go/no-go gates tied to agreed metrics
- documentation and training anchored to real deployments

### 13) What does the adoption timeline look like?
1. 0-30 days: discovery workshops and KPI alignment  
2. 30-90 days: pilot build and field evaluation  
3. 90+ days: scale decision for successful insertion points

### 14) What does commercialization look like?
Commercialization begins with paid pilots and expands into recurring deployment programs, integration services, and longer-term platform positioning in validated verticals.

### 15) What are you asking from a partner?
- pilot and scale-stage capital
- access to operational environments and teams
- active participation in use-case prioritization
- commitment to evidence-based scale decisions

### 16) What does the partner get in return?
- early access to a differentiated compute pathway
- influence on vertical roadmap and deployment priorities
- measured, de-risked expansion model
- upside tied to validated application fit, not speculative volume assumptions

### 17) What could cause this to fail?
Failure modes include poor use-case selection, weak KPI discipline, or attempting broad replacement before proving subsystem-level wins.

### 18) What does disciplined execution look like?
Small pilots, hard metrics, transparent gates, and fast iteration on workload selection, with capital concentration only after evidence.

### 19) What should happen in the first partner meeting?
- align on strategic objectives
- shortlist 3-5 candidate workloads
- define pilot KPIs and decision thresholds
- agree on a 90-day execution plan

### 20) What is the closing message?
This is a joint discovery venture: we do not ask partners to believe first and validate later; we validate first, then scale with confidence.
