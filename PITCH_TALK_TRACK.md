# The Proposal Engine
## Talk Track (10 Slides, 30-60s Each)

### Slide 1: Title
“Thanks for joining. This is The Proposal Engine, a collaborative model for application discovery in asynchronous computing. The core idea is simple: combine capital with active co-discovery to find where this architecture creates measurable advantage in real workloads.”

### Slide 2: The Core Problem
“Many critical systems are constrained by power, thermal limits, and timing uncertainty. Traditional clock-driven compute often addresses this with more software complexity and tighter integration risk. Teams need a more reliable way to hit performance and validation goals.”

### Slide 3: The Strategic Opportunity
“Asynchronous multi-core fabric gives us a structural alternative. Instead of a global clock dependency, we get local deterministic execution, explicit partitioning, and activity-based efficiency. This can reduce overhead where predictability and reliability matter more than synthetic benchmark speed.”

### Slide 4: Partnership, Not Passive Investment
“We are not asking for a passive check. We are proposing a partnership where we jointly select workloads, run focused pilots, and scale only what proves out. This aligns technical evidence with capital allocation from day one.”

### Slide 5: Discovery-to-Scale Model
“Our method has five steps: map workload pain points, pick high-leverage insertion points, co-build pilots, measure KPI outcomes, then decide scale. That sequence keeps risk controlled and avoids overcommitting before results are clear.”

### Slide 6: Proof Point and Generalization
“The HVDC controller case is a proof point in a demanding real-time environment. It shows feasibility for precision control and partitioned execution. Importantly, this is not limited to HVDC; it demonstrates a repeatable method that can generalize across domains.”

### Slide 7: Forest + Sustainable Agriculture Wedge
“Forest management and sustainable agriculture are strong early domains because they combine remote operations, power limits, intermittent connectivity, and high reliability needs. They also have clear sustainability metrics, so value can be demonstrated in both economic and environmental terms.”

### Slide 8: Pilot Use Cases
“Initial pilots can target edge anomaly processing for forest monitoring, irrigation timing and control, environmental sensor filtering, predictive maintenance preprocessing, and microclimate loop control. These are practical insertion points where deterministic edge behavior can matter immediately.”

### Slide 9: KPI and Value Framework
“We evaluate success with concrete metrics: energy per site, anomaly detection latency, water-use efficiency, downtime reduction, false-alert rates, and maintenance overhead. The goal is objective proof that a subsystem-level win is commercially meaningful.”

### Slide 10: Ask + Next 90 Days
“Our ask is capital for pilots, access to operating environments, and active participation in workload prioritization. Over the next 90 days, we run discovery workshops, select 1 to 3 pilot targets, deploy prototypes, and return with KPI-based go/no-go scale recommendations.”

## Delivery Notes
- Keep tempo brisk: 35-45 seconds per slide.
- On Slides 4, 5, and 10, emphasize risk control and measured expansion.
- On Slides 7 and 8, use one concrete field example from the target partner’s operations.
